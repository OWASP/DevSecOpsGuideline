# Vulnerability Management

### What Is Vulnerability Management?  
Vulnerability Management is a continuous process that helps organizations identify, prioritize, remediate and document vulnerabilities in their software and platforms. It is an important part of DevSecOps Lifecycle because it allows the ability to organize the security flaws in a manageable, actionable, and traceable way. Also, VM helps to achieve visibility of the security posture. When VM is executed alongside other processes, it helps minimize the attack surface and bridge the gap between isolated findings across distributed tools and processes. 

### Process Definition

Taking the OWASP VMG Project as a reference, we can describe the overall VM process in three stages: 

* **Detection:** During the detection cycle, we conduct the tasks that support vulnerability tests in essential ways by defining the: who, what, where, why, and how. The principal activities are focused on defining and refining scope after each round of the process, getting tools ready and verifying their integrity, conducting tests, and verifying results. 
* **Reporting:** The reporting cycle targets activities that help the organization understand vulnerability in a measurable way. The principal activities are focused on learning, categorizing, and creating organizational, meaningful metrics that would become the cornerstone of vulnerability management reports.
* **Remediation:** The Remediation cycle targets activities that should reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities or provide evidence as to why vulnerability is believed not to be a threat. Key activities are focused on defining priorities and terms of remediation work, discussing and documenting false positives, and dealing with exceptions.

### How VM Tools can help DevSecOps
The tools we shall use to create a DevSecOps pipeline will generate plenty of vulnerabilities, and each tool will have its own separate format. It becomes challenging to manage this data to track and remediate the vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Management Tools consolidate reports generated by different tools and activities in one or a few dashboards, providing an overview of the security posture. Team Members can track the progress of remediation efforts by metrics, triage and prioritize findings across the entire pipeline, and manage the vulnerabilities lifecycle across the process. Also, engineers can benefit from the de-duplication features, which help them deal with the noise generated by continuous scanning and duplication of findings. Finally, VM Tools provide integrations with other components to enable bi-directional communication, notifications, data export, and report generation.

## Where, When and How

You should implement and integrate VM Tools at the central part of your DevSecOps program to provide governance capabilities at earlier stages of development. Tools like OWASP DefectDojo support automatic CI/CD integration and manual reports, it also includes a Checklist to track your application against Owasp ASVS V4, which is an excellent way to complement the risk analysis process.
