### Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

DAST is a “Black-Box” testing technique that can find security vulnerabilities and weaknesses in a running application by injecting malicious payloads to identify potential flaws that allow for attacks like SQL injections or cross-site scripting (XSS), etc. DAST tools are especially helpful for detecting:
- Input or output validation
- Authentication issues
- Server configuration mistakes

DAST tools allow for extensive scans from the client side and server side without needing the source code or the framework the application is built on. While configuration requires expertise, scans usually require minimal user interaction once configured and can be run as part of a nightly scan. As more important DAST tools we can look at the following:
- Dynamic security scanner
- Fuzzers
- Attack Proxies
