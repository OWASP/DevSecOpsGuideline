# Container Vulnerability Scanning

As containers become an almost ubiquitous method of packaging and deploying applications, the instances of malware have increased. Securing containers is now a top priority for DevOps engineers. Fortunately, a number of open source programs are available that scan containers and container images. Let’s look at five such tools.

## What can Container Security Scanning do?

- Detect insecure containers
  - Detect outdated libraries
  - Detect incorrectly configured containers
  - Detect outdated operating system
- Detect compliance validations
- Suggest best practices

## Issues with Container Security Scanner

- Level of depth depends on tool being used, So the results that you'll get are very dependent on the type of tool you choose.
- Easy to go "too far" with configuration, there are tools where you can configure so much different settings, that it's easy to jump overboard.
- The scan results will lead to actionable events?

## Where and When to use Container Scanner?

You can use it at the build phase when you're actually building for instance a Dockerfile and looking at the resulting image that you're creating. Another location to perform container scanning would be when you push a container to the registry or when you pull a container from a registry. However, a good approach is scanning before pushing into a trusted container registry then you can say we have a container registry with a scanned version of all images and for deploying in production you can pull from this trusted container registry. (Plase take look into the following image)
