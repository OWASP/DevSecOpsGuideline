# Static scanning is an important part of the process

![Static scanning diagram showing analysis process](/current-version/assets/images/Static scanning.png)

Static Code Analysis or Source Code Analysis is usually part of a Code Review (white-box testing) and it is a method of computer program debugging that is done by examining the code without executing the program.

Static scanning is good way finding coding issues such as:

- Syntax violations
- Security vulnerabilities
- Programming errors
- Coding standard violations
- Undefined values

For more information about the Static Code Analysis please visit [the OWASP page](https://owasp.org/www-community/controls/Static_Code_Analysis)
To achieve a better result we can combine static security scanning and 3rd party code (open-source libraries (dependency) scanning.
To doing this part better and more complete (prevent misconfigurations), we can bring up IaC (Infrastructure as code) security scan too. For example check Terraform, helm, Ansible code, etc.
So according to the above lines the possible actions in this step are as follows:

- Static Code Analysis (known as SAST)
- Open-source libraries (3rd party / dependency) scanning (known as SCA)
- IaC Security scanning
